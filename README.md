Tentative-Discord-Bot
----
## Summary on what this is:
>So this is not something to be used, but something to look at and get an idea of how to make a discord bot or simply copy paste stuff from. I made it when i was learning how to use an api and i thought discord would be a good start. The reason of uploading it is because i wanna get a template or use it as a reference if i ever need to actually make one.

## Requirements:
* Python 3.x
* Modules: discord, json, asyncio, youtbe_dl, dotenv
* FFmpeg (and in path if on windows)

## Main features:
* Basic commands like: kick, ban, giverole, removerole, prefix, autorole etc
* Quite complex music player but with a few bugs (with commands such as: play, queue, volume, skip etc)
* Tip: use .help to see all commands.

## Bugs and issues:
Quite a lot probably and i don't have a list because as i said this a simple prototype.
